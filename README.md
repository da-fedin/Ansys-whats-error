## What's Ansys-whats-error?
During the debugging of the Ansys Mechanical analyses one faces with troubleshooting on the basis of error messages exposed to Mechanical GUI. Sometimes, especially in case of using APDL commands, such messages aren't informative enough and user is forced to browse the Solution Output by hands to find description of the error.

It's annoying! This repo contains demo source files for the scripted ACT-extension which allows to show native MAPDL error message in one click.
## How does it work?
Place these files on the local drive and install them as a scripted **ACT-extension** to **Ansys Workbench**. After that, **WhatsError toolbar** will be acceptable in Mechanical GUI with one button showing the error message after solve.

## Who can use it?
This code can be used by Ansys users with the **appropriate license**.
## What is the goal of this project?
This project is a simple example that aims to show simplicity and value of **Ansys Customization Suite** capabilities.
